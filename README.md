IN this project i try to create Python scripts to process, visualize, and model accelerometer and gyroscope data to create a machine learning model that can classify barbell exercises and count repetitions.
I build this project through several steps
 — Converting raw data, reading CSV files, splitting data, cleaning
 — Visualizing data, plotting time series data
 — Outlier detection, Chauvenet’s criterion, local outlier factor
 — Feature engineering, frequency, low pass filter, PCA, clustering
 — Predictive modelling, Naive Bayes, SVMs, random forest, neural network
 — Counting repetitions, creating a custom algorithm
